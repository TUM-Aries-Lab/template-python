# Template-Python

Do ***NOT*** clone this repository. Please use it as a template instead—this README is meant to help you get started quickly.

The file cookiecutter.json has the following contents:
```
{
  "repo_name": "temp-python",
  "module_name": "new-repo",
  "package_name": "new_repo",
  "org_name": "TUM-Aries-Lab",
  "description": "Basic description for the repo.",
  "author_name": "Tony Smoragiewicz",
  "author_email": "tony.smoragiewicz@tum.de",
  "python_version": "3.12",
  "version": "0.0.1"
}
```

## Steps
1. Make the necessary names changes in `cookiecutter.json` and then run:
2. ` cookiecutter .  # This will create a new repo with the correct names in place.`
3. You can then delete everything but the code in your newly generated folder.
4. Commit your new changes.
